#CHATBOT USING KERAS
A chatbot created using Keras is a computer program that can communicate with users through text. Keras is a Python library used for building neural networks, which are mathematical models inspired by the human brain.

In this context:

We collect examples of conversations between users and the chatbot.
We use these examples to train a neural network model, teaching it to understand questions and generate appropriate responses.
During training, the model learns patterns in the data, adjusting its internal parameters to improve its ability to generate accurate responses.
Once trained, the model can be used to interact with users in a conversational manner, responding to their queries based on what it learned during training.
Overall, a chatbot built with Keras aims to simulate human-like conversation by using machine learning techniques to process and generate text-based responses.
